# Database Managment: Algebra Operations
In this program we implement the following relational algebra operators: Select, Project, Union, Minus and Join.

## Files Description: 
1.	Table.java: This file contains Table class which implements relational database tables.  Five basic relational algebra operators are provided: project, select, union, minus and join as functions (partially implemented). The insert data manipulation operator is also provided. Missing are update and delete manipulation operators.  
2.	Keytype.java: This file contains KeyType class which provides a key type for handling both non-composite and composite keys. A key is a minimal set of attributes that can be used to uniquely identify a tuple. 
3.	ArrayUtil.java: Concatenate two arrays to form a new wider array.  
4.	MovieDB.java: This file contains MovieDB class which generates a Movies database, which will be used to evaluate the 5 relational algebra operators implemented.
